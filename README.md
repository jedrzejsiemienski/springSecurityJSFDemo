# springSecurityJSFDemo

It is a sample project that allows an user to create an account,
login, change user's name and city, remove other users.

This simple demo uses:
- spring + hibernate for model layer
- spring security for authentication and authorisation
- JSF for presentation layer

It was forked from my private github account, where I use
my nickname (jenczuen).
